# Parser
Trivial implementation of a numerical parser using Python's regular expressions library, implemented for my finite automata course.

Intentionally coded as an endless loop which repeatedly queries user for string input and determines if it is a number or an error, with numbers of the following types:

* Decimal (Base 10 Integer)
* Floating Point (Base 10 Real)
* Octal
* Scientific Notation
